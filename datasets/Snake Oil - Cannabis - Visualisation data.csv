","The effects of Cannabis itself on tinnitus in humans and animals are still unclear. However, CB1 receptors do exist in the CN and they are functional. Although cannabinoids have been shown to exert anti-epileptic effects in many parts of the brain, the function of CB1 receptors in the circuitry of the DCN, at least, suggests that they might have the potential to facilitate increased excitation rather than inhibit it, which, if neuronal hyperactivity is part of the cause of tinnitus, might exacerbate tinnitus rather than relieve it. Along those lines, the only animal study of the effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists in tinnitus suggests that tinnitus might be aggravated [42]. Although another study showed that CB1 receptors were downregulated in the VCN in an animal model of tinnitus [30], it is not clear whether this might be part of the cause of tinnitusrelated neuronal hyperactivity or a compensatory response to it. Therefore, at this stage, it is very unclear whether cannabinoid drugs that activate the CB1 receptor would make tinnitus worse or better.
